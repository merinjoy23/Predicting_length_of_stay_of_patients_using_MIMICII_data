## Predicting_length_of_stay_of_patients_using_MIMICII_data

This study deals with predicting the hospital length of stay using Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes classifier and Random Forest model with various diagnoses based on selected characteristics. The models are trained to predict whether the patient’s length of stay will be long(>median) or short(≤median). Here, longer and shorter stay is determined using the median of length of stay evaluated using the data in MIMIC III database. Required tables are drawn from the MIMIC III database and all codes are written in Python.
